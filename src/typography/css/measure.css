  MEASURE
  Docs: http://aircss.io/docs/typography/measure.html

  Measure or line length is the distance between the left and right edges of a text block. Overly
  long lines are a common problem, but they're easy to correct. Shorter lines will make a big
  difference in the legibility and professionalism of your layout.


  Mnemonics
  =========

  Bases:
    ll = line-length

  Modifiers:
    -narrow — average length of 45 characters
    -medium — average length of 66 characters
    -wide — average length of 80 characters

  Optional extensions:
    -m = medium width container
    -l = large width container


  Shorthand
  =========

  It is possible to use the class name `measure` instead of `measure-medium`.
