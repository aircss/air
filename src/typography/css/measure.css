  MEASURE
  Docs: http://aircss.io/docs/typography/measure.html

  Measure or line length is the distance between the left and right edges of a text block. Overly
  long lines are a common problem, but they're easy to correct. Shorter lines will make a big
  difference in the legibility and professionalism of your layout.
